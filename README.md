# Power BI Dashboard Project - Retail Store Sales Data

This project focuses on creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize the sales data of a retail store. The dashboard presents insights into key performance metrics such as sales trends, revenue, product performance, and customer behavior. The goal of this project is to provide decision-makers with actionable insights to help optimize store operations and improve overall sales performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains retail store sales data, which includes information about sales transactions, customers, products, and stores. The dataset contains the following key variables:

### Features:
- **Product ID**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Product Name**: Name of the product sold.
- **Sales Date**: The date when the sales transaction occurred.
- **Sales Amount**: The total sales value of the transaction.
- **Quantity Sold**: Number of items sold in the transaction.
- **Store ID**: Unique identifier for each store location.
- **Store Name**: Name of the retail store.
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Customer Location**: Geographical location of the customer.
- **Payment Method**: The method used for payment (e.g., Credit Card, Cash).

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard that allows users to:

- Analyze sales performance over time (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly).
- Identify top-performing products and stores.
- Analyze customer behavior and purchasing patterns.
- Make data-driven decisions to improve sales and optimize store operations.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Data Import and Integration**: Imported the retail sales data into Power BI from various sources (Excel, CSV, etc.).
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Cleaned and transformed the data to ensure consistency and remove any errors or inconsistencies.
3. **Data Modeling**: Created relationships between tables (Sales, Products, Customers, Stores) to create a unified data model.
4. **Data Visualization**: Designed and developed multiple interactive visualizations, including:
   - Sales trends over time (line charts, bar charts).
   - Product performance (top products, sales by category).
   - Customer analysis (sales by location, payment method distribution).
   - Store performance (sales by store, sales comparison between stores).
5. **Dashboard Development**: Built an interactive Power BI dashboard that allows users to filter and explore the data through slicers and drill-through features.
6. **Report Customization**: Applied custom themes, colors, and visualizations to make the dashboard user-friendly and visually appealing.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard development.
- **Excel/CSV**: For data storage and initial data preprocessing.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating calculated columns and measures in Power BI.

## Key Features of the Dashboard

- **Sales Trend Analysis**: Interactive charts that show sales trends over time, allowing users to filter by date range, store, and product.
- **Top Products**: A list of top-selling products based on sales revenue, quantity sold, or units sold.
- **Customer Insights**: Visualizations showing customer purchasing behavior, including sales by customer location and payment method.
- **Store Performance Comparison**: A comparison of sales performance across different stores, highlighting high-performing and underperforming stores.
- **Interactive Filters**: Slicers and drill-through features to allow users to filter and drill into specific data points for deeper insights.

## Final Outcome

The final outcome of this project is a comprehensive, interactive Power BI dashboard that provides valuable insights into retail store sales performance. The dashboard enables users to monitor key metrics, track sales trends, and make informed decisions to improve sales and customer engagement.
